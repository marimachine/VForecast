VForecast
=========

Data and code for the V-Dem VForecast/PART project to predict the risk of adverse regime transitions.

*Note for Rick and Andy: The original work in late 2018 and early 2019 leading up to the May 2019 Policy Day was all done on Dropbox in the `regime-forecast` folder. I copied some of the contents of that folder here, and also bumped up one level a smaller partial copy of `regime-forecast` that was in this repo from before.*
